# React App with Routing and Components

## Assignment Overview

This project was created as part of the assignment titled "React App with Routing and Components." The objective was to build a React application with three components (Home, Navbar, and FormAction) and implement routing to navigate between these components. Additionally, a FormAction component was designed to gather user input.

## Components

### 1. Home
The Home component is responsible for displaying user details, including name, age, email, and address.

### 2. Navbar
The Navbar component serves as the navigation bar for the application.

### 3. FormAction
FormAction is a component that includes a form to collect user input. It features input fields for Name, Age, Address, and EmailID.

## Navigation and Routing

The application implements routing to allow seamless navigation between components. Routes are defined to render the Home and FormAction components based on user navigation.
